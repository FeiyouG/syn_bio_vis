## Run this project

First, ensure `node.js` and `npm` are installed on your machine.

Then, clone and `cd` into `syn_bio_vis/server/` and run
```shell
$npm install
```
to install all the dependencies for the server. Run `npm start` to start the
server. The server is running in `port 3000` by default.

Next, `cd` into `syn_bio_vis/client/` and run
```shell
$npm install
```
to install all the dependencies for the server. Run `npm start` to start the
client. A website will be opened in your default browser.
