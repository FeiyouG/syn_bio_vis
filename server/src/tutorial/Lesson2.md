## Introduction

DNA strand displacement (aka DSD) is a type of molecular computation that takes advantage of the complementarity of DNA base pairs to perform computations. This page displays a simulation of what we understand about the overall behavior of DNA as it binds to another strand.

Below the visualization, you'll find more detail about what is happening in the visualization to enable molecular computation.
